#### Task Description

Design, implement and maintain an online mentorship platform. It's a place where
Mentors and Mentees meet and help each other grow their skills and careers.

#### Skills and technology

Stack:
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/)
- JS, CSS3, HTML 5

This was a freelance project. I was hired to improve the brand image and help
grow the community of mentors through re-implementation of their current website. 
The task was to use a technology that is easy to use for community administrators 
and will be able to expand with functionality as the community grows. In order to
succeed at this project I had to successfully sell my technical skills and
then develop the product along with the input of the community founders and project
collaborators. I maintain, improve and take active part in the community as both
mentor and mentee.
